# Visualising-World-Happiness-Report
This repository contains Python scripts and data files for analyzing global happiness trends and visualizing them using various data visualization techniques. 
The analysis primarily focuses on exploring factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and perceptions of corruption.

Key Features includes 

Data Sources: The analysis uses datasets from the World Happiness Report, covering multiple years to track changes over time.

Visualization Techniques: Utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express for generating visual insights including scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and choropleth maps.


Scatter Plots: Visualizes the relationship between GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Bar Charts: Compares happiness scores across different regions and years using Plotly Express, providing insights into regional variations.

Heatmaps: Displays correlation matrices of happiness factors like GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy using Seaborn.

Choropleth Maps: Maps GDP per capita values across countries using Plotly Express on a global map projection.

Data Preparation: Includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating pivot tables for summarizing data by region and year.

Interactive Visualizations: Demonstrates interactive plots using Plotly Express for exploring regional variations in happiness scores and related factors.

The analysis uses datasets sourced from the World Happiness Report for multiple years (2016-2019).
Initial data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and merging datasets across different years.
